  1. npm run seed
  2. npm run build
  3. npm run start

* From the terminal where you ran 'run run seed', copy a random _id (it will look something similar to _id: 5f20eafd87ebd2245e2e4dcd).

* Then, paste that id on line 38 of client/src/component/App.jsx. This should be where it says: this.productid = **place id here**

* You should then be able to open the webapp on localhost:1738
